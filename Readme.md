### Remember Do Pull Request 
[Forget how?](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/)
1. Make a new branch: Bellow where it says "some-feature" is the name of the new branch that will hold your code.
```
git checkout -b some-feature
```
2. Commit & push it!
```
git commit -a -m "Add first draft of some feature"
git push origin some-branch
```
3. Creat a [pull request:](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) If there is a merge conflict you may want to request a [review](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review). Once there are no conflicts complete your merge & delete the branch on GitHub.

***Delete a Branch on Computer***
1. See the existing branches.
```
git branch -a
```
2. Delete the branch you don't want.
```
git branch -D <local-branch>
```

### Pull Master
[git info](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout)
1. if you have edits make sure they were not on the master, if so you can move to step 2. If not got to step 1 & make a new branch
```
git checkout -b some-feature
git commit -a -m "Add first draft of some feature"
```
2. Checkout Master
```
git checkout -q master
```
3. Pull
```
git pull
```
