### Remember Do Pull Request 
[Forget how?](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/)
1. Make a new branch: Bellow where it says "some-feature" is the name of the new branch that will hold your code.
```
git checkout -b some-feature
```
2. Commit & push it!
```
git commit -a -m "Add first draft of some feature"
git push origin some-branch
```
3. Creat a [pull request:](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) If there is a merge conflict you may want to request a [review](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review). Once there are no conflicts complete your merge & delete the branch.
